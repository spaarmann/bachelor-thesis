# Cluster Editing Bachelor Thesis Presentation

About 25 minutes for the whole presentation.

TODO: Where do we first mention the weighted problem and our use of it?

## Introduction

- What is a cluster graph?
- What is Cluster Editing?
- Why is Cluster Editing interesting?
  - Motivation from practical applications in biology etc.
  - Mention PACE challenge, "we're doing this in a context that's a bit more abstract, because ..."
- Quick formal definitions

## Fixed-Parameter Algorithms

- Cluster Editing is NP-complete
- So what do we do to solve it as efficiently as possible?
- -> Definition of fixed-parameter algorithm, introduce our parameter

- Two central concepts: Bounded Search Tree algorithms and kernels / data reduction rules

## Search Tree

- Bounded search tree algorithms: definition
- Bounded search tree algorithms: 3^k search tree for Cluster Editing

- Our branching strategy / algorithm

## Data Reduction Rules

- Reduction Rules: Definition, Correctness

- Our reduction rules

## Implementation Details

- Graph Storage
- Undo
- Merging ?
- Conflict Tracking ?

## Results

- some graphs I guess
